# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- feat: automate draft release creation on tag push. Pushing a git tag now triggers the release workflow, which creates a draft release and attaches the modules archive. The draft can then be reviewed and published manually.

## [1.2.0] – Release workflow and dead code removal

### Added

- feat: GitHub Actions workflow to build and publish a modules archive on release creation.

### Changed

- feat: remove unused code from `organization_validation` module (`1.1.1`).

## [1.1.1] – Per-module semver versioning and CI tooling

### Added

- feat: add Dependabot for automated dependency updates and MegaLinter for code quality checks.
